# Diagnostics — measured investigations into specific defects

purpose: the single home for "why does it fail, and what did we test" — the probe results, including the ones that came back negative
audience: agents and the owner, before proposing a fix for a known weakness
updated: 2026-07-28

Split out of [METRICS.md](METRICS.md) on 2026-07-28 when that file crossed the 400-line cap. The
split is by genre: METRICS.md keeps the **scoreboard** (what the model scores, against which floors);
this file keeps the **investigations** behind those scores. Nothing is duplicated.

**Read the negative results.** Most of what follows is a hypothesis that was tested and did not
survive — each one is a change that was not built on a guess, and re-proposing it costs a round.

### ⛔ A ~2% pre-shrink: exam −15.5%, real-val −1.6%. DID NOT REPLICATE (2026-07-28)

Per-strip staff-line spacing, measured on the strips as they reach the model. The slicer targets
`TARGET_SPACING = 30.0` px; the renderer produces exactly that.

| pool | mean px | sd | p10 | p90 | vs synthetic |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| synthetic `strips_v4` | **30.000** | **0.000** | 30.000 | 30.000 | — |
| real exam | **30.496** | 2.096 | 29.50 | 31.75 | **+1.65%** |
| real-val | 30.197 | 1.032 | 29.75 | 30.50 | +0.66% |
| real nota | 30.122 | 0.701 | 29.50 | 30.75 | +0.41% |

Correcting the size at inference (`scripts/rung3/staff_geometry_probe.py`, frozen
`round2-stage2-best` on the frozen 326-strip exam; rung 0 reproduces the 562-edit total exactly):

| scale applied | exam edits | vs baseline |
|---|---|---|
| identity | 562 | — |
| 0.990 | 486 | −13.5% |
| **0.980** | **475** | **−15.5%** |
| 0.975 | 494 | −12.1% |
| 0.960 | 541 | −3.7% |

- **Not monotonic** — it rises at both ends, ruling out "smaller is always better". The 1–2.5% basin
  is flat, so the exact optimum is **not resolvable at n=326**; the evidence is four independent
  scale values all landing 12–15.5% better.
- Vertical placement is **not** the cause: shift +1% gave +0.4% edits. Only scale mattered.
- Resampling is **not** the cause: an identity warp through the same interpolation gave 562 exactly.
- ⛔ **It does not generalise.** The same operation on the **real-val holdout** gives 247 → 243
  edits, **−1.6%**. The exam result came after ~15 variations were tried against the exam and the
  best was reported — selection on the test set. **Do not act on this.**
- ⚠ Not fully closed: real-val is the easy pool (0.9 edits/strip vs 1.7) and lacks the hard tier, so
  an effect confined to hard pages could hide there. Re-test after the real-val rebuild.
- ⚠ No mechanism was ever found. Ruled out: resampling (down-up 555), blur (562), ink lighten (565),
  ink thin (589), and staff-size matching — the exam benefit appears in **every** size bucket
  (undersized −33%, ~right −10%, oversized −16%), not just oversized strips.
- ⚠ **The staff-size explanation is DISPROVED.** Rescaling each strip individually to exactly
  30.000 px gives only **528 edits (−6.0%)** — less than half the blunt global shrink. If the model
  simply wanted the training spacing, exact per-strip matching would have won. It did not.
- ⚠ The estimator hypothesis is also disproved: `Staff.spacing` (median of gaps) vs the endpoint
  span that actually sets the crop height measures **span/median = 0.998** over 357 staves,
  predicting 29.95 px — not the 30.5 observed (`scripts/rung3/spacing_estimator_probe.py`).
- Current slicer output spacing is **30.353** against the old code's 30.494, so the bias narrowed
  but persists. Synthetic is exactly 30.000 (sd 0.000).
- **Do not act on this until the mechanism is known.** Untested candidates: ink weight, stroke
  thinning under INTER_AREA, encoder preprocessing.

### Decode confidence predicts correctness, and the review confirms it (2026-07-28)

`round2-stage2-best` re-decoding the exam's 145 hand-labelled HARD strips, bucketed by the decode's
minimum per-token log-probability — then the same buckets as the owner labels the `realval-hard`
queue (69 of 130 done at time of writing):

| min_logprob | exam hard: decode exactly right | realval-hard `ok` | realval-hard **`bad` crop** |
|---|---|---|---|
| > −0.1 | **80%** (51 strips) | 83% (53) | **6%** |
| −0.5 … −0.1 | 28% (40) | 50% (30) | 27% |
| −1.0 … −0.5 | 10% (31) | 21% (29) | **55%** |
| < −1.0 | **4%** (23) | 0% (18) | **89%** |
| all | 39% (145) | 50% (130) | **33%** |

Owner-labelled, all 130 rows: **65 ok / 22 fix / 43 bad**.

- Real signal, and the two measurements agree in the top bucket; used to order the labelling queue.
  ⚠ It orders the work, it does **not** license skipping rows — the top bucket is still wrong 1 in 5.
  ⚠ `ok` is looser than "exactly right", so the middle buckets are not directly comparable.
- **Low confidence strongly predicts a BAD CROP** — 16 of the 18 strips below −1.0 were rejected
  crops (89%), and the bad rate falls monotonically with confidence. ⚠ **Corrects an earlier claim
  in this file** that "confidence cannot detect a bad crop", which was drawn from the first 7 `bad`
  verdicts; the full 130 contradict it. High confidence still does not *guarantee* a good crop
  (6% of the top bucket were bad), so it is a screen, not a proof.
- **33% of the old slicer's hard strips are unusable crops** (43 of 130) — the slicer's failure rate
  on the material it had already flagged as doubtful. Only 87 were usable against 110 needed, so a
  re-slice was required regardless.
- First measured evidence the confidence signal carries information, bearing on the deferred
  error-localisation feature (pre-registered at TOKEN level; this is per strip).

### The labelling pools are OLD-SLICER output (2026-07-28)

Strips on disk were written 2026-07-15..17; `page_to_strips.py` was overhauled 2026-07-25 and the
pools were never re-sliced. Re-slicing 5 queue pages and comparing crop-for-crop:

**0 of 30 crops are identical**, 2 no longer exist, and old slivers became full rows
(`gonul_sana_tapali..._s03_w00` **207 px → 1435 px**; `yuru_dilber_ney_p1_s01_w02` 409 → 1038) —
the sliver behaviour the overhaul fixed. **The frozen exam carries the same 2026-07-15..17 crops**,
so exam and real-val are consistent with each other but both measure a slicer no longer shipped.
Owner's read while labelling: the model does well, the failures were the old slicer's — though the
current slicer's crops still have some issues. Measured on 5 pages (164 old vs 147 current crops,
small sample, indicative only):

| | old slicer | current slicer |
|---|---|---|
| crops < 350 px (slivers) | 3.0% | **0.7%** |
| min_logprob < −1.0 (predicts a broken crop) | 3.0% | **0.7%** |
| min_logprob < −0.5 | 9.8% | 10.2% |
| clean and confident (> −0.1) | 72.6% | 70.7% |

**The catastrophic crops are ~4x rarer; the moderate ones are unchanged.** Re-slicing removes the
sliver class, not every bad crop — matching the owner's observation exactly.

### Crop shape and beam weight (2026-07-28) — costs confirmed, both mechanisms disproved

Whole-exam decode, 326 strips, 562 edits. Per-bucket detail in
[rung3/round3.md](rung3/round3.md); source `scripts/rung3/empty_crop_probe.py`,
`width_split_probe.py`, `beam_weight_probe.py`.

| finding | number |
|---|---|
| crops with ≤3 notes | **5.5% of strips, 20.8% of all edits** (0.5–1.06 edits/gold token vs 0.03–0.05) |
| crops >1200 px | 13.8% of strips, **28.6% of edits** (0.082/token) |
| note-free crops that invented notes | **1 of 8** — bar was ≥50%, so **not hallucination** |
| splitting wide crops at a gutter | **132 → 174 edits, +31.8%** (19 of 45 have no internal bar-line) |
| slicer old → current, same 67 pages | <350 px **3.4% → 1.4%**; >1200 px **13.8% → 27.8%** |
| beam thickness, median | synthetic **0.500 S** (v4 = v5); real nota 0.567 S, exam 0.765 S |

- The 22%-too-thick sharp-bar finding **does not transfer** to beams — ours match the engraving
  standard and real print is *heavier*. ⚠ Thick tails are contaminated (synthetic = double beams,
  real = ink bleed); only the median is usable. ⚠ Measures **thickness**, not **grouping**, so it
  cannot validate `USUL_BEAM_GROUPS`.
- Post-encoder the model sees synthetic beams at **6.5 px** and real at **9–14.6 px** — a *width*
  effect, since our strips average 1229 px against real 904–1018 and shrink harder through the
  encoder's fixed box.


## The microtonal-sharp defect (measured against two real printed editions)

| Quantity | Real print | Bravura (ours, before) | Ours, after `--thin-sharps` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sharp bar thickness | 0.300 S | 0.367 S (+22%) | 0.300 S |
| küçük bar pitch (spacing) | 0.550 S | 0.483 S (−14%) | 0.65 S (deliberately wider) |
| küçük white gap | 0.250 S | **0.116 S** (~1–2 px after the encoder shrink) | clears the shrink |

- koma/bakiye were never at risk (0.58–0.66 S gaps).
- The error was **one-directional**: gold `\kucukSharp` decoded as `\komaSharp` **11× on the clean
  exam, 10× on photos**; the reverse essentially never. Matches the 100%-precision / 48%-recall
  signature.
- Resolution was **ruled out**: recall does not fall with encoder scale (1.22 → 0.24) on either
  dataset; `\bakiyeSharp` holds 84–94% in every bucket.
### Where the sharps are PRINTED (measured 2026-07-26 — corrects the framing above)

Every gold and corpus label split into tokens inside the row-start `\sig … \sigend` block versus
tokens on a note. The scorers count both (no stripping), so both feed the AEU headline.

| Set | `\kucukSharp` on a note | `\kucukSharp` in the signature |
|---|---|---|
| Clean exam v2.1 (352 strips) | **1** | **30** |
| Clean exam, contamination-corrected (326) | 1 | 32 |
| Photo gold (109 hand-corrected labels) | 3 | 13 |
| `strips_v3` corpus | 234 tokens / 206 strips | 1,210 strips |

- **The class is scored almost entirely in the key signature**, not on noteheads. `\komaSharp` runs
  the same way on the exam (2 inline / 12 in-signature).
- Structural reason: the carry serializer's `sigTolerant` rule prints a note bare when its
  alteration runs the same direction as the signature's (SymbTr stores the SOUNDING value — eviç is
  a 5-comma F♯ printed bare under a koma-sharp-F signature). Real pages therefore rarely print
  küçük on a note at all. Verified end-to-end: a dry render of two küçük-heavy pieces under
  non-küçük signature variants produced **zero** inline `\kucukSharp`.
- **In the context that scores, `strips_v3` is not imbalanced**: küçük appears in 1,210 signature
  strips against koma's 1,422 (bakiye 6,512). The 9× "1,887 vs 206" gap below is an inline-only
  statistic about a context holding ~1 of the exam's 33 küçük tokens.
- The real corpus gap is **diversity, not count**: signature-position küçük comes from just **3
  makams** (mahur, nisaburek, süzidilara) and 4 distinct spellings.
- **Inline counts, for the record:** `strips_v3` carries `\komaSharp` inline in 1,887 strips vs
  `\kucukSharp` in 206 (0.5%), and zero strips hold both. Kept because it is a true statement about
  note-position coverage — it is simply not what the exam measures.


## The slicer's windowing was never retuned after the 2026-07-25 fix (2026-07-29)

**The fix itself was right.** The old staff-detection kernel (`w/4`) lost the ends of staff lines,
pushing `x0` **70–490 px right** and cutting off clefs and whole measures (see the comment in
`_emit_staff`). `STAFF_HOR_FRAC = 0.11` stopped that. Measured wins on 158 re-sliced val-side pages:

| | old slicer | current slicer |
|---|---|---|
| crops < 350 px (slivers) | 10.4% | **1.2%** |
| crops > 1200 px | 18.5% | 29.7% |
| median width | 851 px | 1001 px |

**But rows now carry more music, and the windowing constants still assume truncated rows.**
`MEASURES_PER_STRIP = 3` and `MAX_STRIP_W = 1450` predate the fix. Decoding both crop sets with the
**same** model over 6 pages (the earlier n_ids comparison was confounded — the two `decode.json`
caches were written by different models):

| | old slicer | current slicer |
|---|---|---|
| crops | 115 | 116 |
| median decoded ids | 42 | **49** |
| **≥ 59 ids — over the label budget** | **20.9%** | **31.9%** |

The emitter drops those as `over_budget`, so content is captured correctly and then thrown away.
On one re-sliced page the probe emit gave `accepted=3 review=2 dropped=25` of 30, with
`over_budget: 11`.

**Sweep of `MEASURES_PER_STRIP`** (env-overridable; 6 pages; "usable" = crops whose decode fits the
59-id budget):

| measures/window | strips | median ids | over budget | **usable** | median width |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | 138 | 41 | 22.5% | **107** | 848 px |
| 2 | 123 | 46 | 26.8% | 90 | 980 px |
| 3 (current) | 116 | 49 | 31.9% | **79** | 1014 px |

Monotonic — the current value is the worst of the three on usable yield, and 1 measure/window gives
**35% more usable strips**. ⚠ This does **not** mean 1 is the answer: "usable" counts only budget
fit, and ignores that narrower windows carry less context, give the stitcher more pieces to
reassemble, and open a train/test mismatch against a synthetic corpus built at 2–4 measures. It says
the constant is worth retuning, not what to retune it to.

**A second, smaller defect.** `MEASURES_PER_STRIP` is not enforced: the sliver-merge in
`window_measures` checks the width cap but not the measure cap, so a full 3-measure window that
absorbs a sliver becomes 4 or 5. **13 of 3,168** re-sliced strips, none of them `split_wide`. Small,
but it feeds straight into the budget overflow above.

**Unchanged by the overhaul:** the moderate-quality band. Crops at `min_logprob < -0.5` sit at ~10%
under both slicers — the fix removed the catastrophic crops, not the mediocre ones.
