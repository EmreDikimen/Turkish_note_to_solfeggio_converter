# Metrics — the real exam

purpose: every number the one-shot real-page exam has produced, round by round
audience: agents and the owner, whenever an exam result is quoted or compared

updated: 2026-08-15

Split out of [METRICS.md](METRICS.md) on 2026-08-11, when that file reached its 400-line cap — this
section was 188 of its 399 lines. **Nothing here changed in the move.** Every other measured number
still lives in [METRICS.md](METRICS.md); raw run logs are in
[../src/vision/MODEL_EVAL.md](../src/vision/MODEL_EVAL.md).

⚠ **The exam is one-shot**: `data/real/rung3/testset.json` pieces are never trained on, and the exam
is read once per round on the final model. All iteration happens on real-val, which
[METRICS.md](METRICS.md) warns does **not** predict this number — the measured gap is 28pp.

⚠ **The AEU headline is a per-class mean and is fragile to low-n classes.** Quote micro and
macro≥30 beside it; see the caveats in [METRICS.md](METRICS.md).

## Model quality — real exam (never trained on, read once per round)

| Read | Date | Set | AEU recall | AEU F1 | SER | Exact |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| First real baseline *(superseded, LOW-N)* | 2026-07-12 | 33 strips | 83.3% | — | 0.018 | 78.8% |
| Exam v2.1 baseline | 2026-07-20 | 352 strips | 64.1% | 57.0% | 0.147 | 17.3% |
| Round 1, as read | 2026-07-22 | 352 strips | 66.6% | 67.0% | 0.059 | 49.1% |
| Round 1, contamination-corrected | 2026-07-22 | 327 clean strips | 66.63 → 66.26% | 66.98 → 66.53% | 0.0591 → 0.0597 | — |
| Round 1, re-scored after gold re-audit | 2026-07-25 | 352 strips, 13 gold fixes | 78.5% | 78.0% | 0.059 | — |
| **Round 2, read once** | **2026-07-27** | **326 clean strips** | **74.2%** | **73.9%** | **0.052** | **52.1%** |

### Round 2 vs Round 1 — identical 326 strips, identical re-audited gold

`round1-best` was scored on this exact set on 2026-07-25, so the comparison needs no adjustment.

| | Round 1 | Round 2 | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| mean AEU F1 | **78.0%** | **73.9%** | **−4.1pp** |
| AEU recall headline | 78.5% | 74.2% | −4.3pp |
| SER | 0.059 | **0.052** | better |
| exact match | 50.0% | **52.1%** | better |

### The product goal — corrections a user faces per page (baseline 2026-07-27)

From `eval_omr.py`'s `EDITS/PAGE` block on the 326-strip clean exam (46 pages, 7.1 strips/page).
One "edit" = one token substitution, deletion or insertion needed to turn the output into gold.

| | Round 2 | target |
|---|---|---|
| **pages needing ≤5 corrections** | **57%** | **≥90%** |
| median edits/page | 5 | — |
| mean edits/page | 12.2 | — |
| strips already perfect | 52% | — |

- The distribution is **heavily right-skewed** — median 5 against a mean of 12.2 — so the goal is
  stated on the *share of pages*, not the median. A median target would have been satisfied on the
  day it was written.
- ⚠ The exam is a **matched upper bound** (its pieces exist in SymbTr); real uploads will be worse.
- The second half of the goal — the app showing *where* the errors are — is unmeasured, because it
  does not exist yet. Finding 5 unknown errors among ~250 notes costs more than fixing them.

### Where the user's corrections actually go (2026-07-27) — accidentals are 13% of them

Every one of the 562 edits in the Round-2 exam read, classified by what the user would have to fix
(token-level alignment over the 156 mismatching strips in `data/colab/round2-exam-errors.txt`).

| what needs fixing | edits | share | excl. the 12 catastrophic strips |
|---|---|---|---|
| **pitch (letter/octave)** | 222 | **40%** | 36% |
| **duration** | 158 | **28%** | 29% |
| rhythm signs (tie/triplet/grace) | 74 | 13% | 16% |
| **accidentals** | 73 | **13%** | 13% |
| structure (barlines, repeats, nav) | 26 | 5% | 5% |
| signature delimiters | 9 | 2% | 1% |

- **Two rounds of work went into the 13%.** The old headline made accidentals look like the whole
  problem because it only measured accidentals.
- **Errors are concentrated:** 42 of 326 strips (13%) carry 63% of all edits; 11 strips carry 29%;
  12 strips are >50% wrong and carry 21%. Under the page-based goal, those are what push a page
  over the 5-correction line.
- **…but not only concentrated:** excluding the 12 catastrophic strips barely moves the mix, so
  pitch and duration are pervasively weak on ordinary strips too.
- Note-level substitution mix (96 subs): duration only 38%, multiple-differ 30%, letter only 27%,
  **octave only 5%**. Plus **55 whole notes inserted or deleted** — the model losing count, not
  misreading a glyph.

#### The crop-shape gap (the cause of the catastrophic strips)

| | signature-only strips |
|---|---|
| `strips_v4` (training) | **0 of 40,826** |
| exam v2.1 clean | **4 of 326**; 91 strips (28%) have ≤8 label words |

`stripExport` always builds chunks from whole measures, so a "clef + donanım, no notes" image
cannot occur in training — but the slicer produces them from real pages. The worst exam strip is
exactly that: gold `\sig \kucukFlat b \kucukFlat e \kucukFlat a \sigend`, decode a hallucinated
`\volta2 b'16 c''8 g''8 g''8` — **19 edits against 8 gold tokens.**

#### Gold octave errors — real, but NOT a lever (negative result, keep it)

All 5 octave-only substitutions are cases where the GOLD leaps ≥4 scale steps from both neighbours
while the model reads the stepwise line (e.g. gold `a''8` between `b'` and `g'`; model `a'8`).
They are almost certainly mislabels — consistent with the adjudication precedent of siding with the
decode 187:14. But the scale is small and the pools are clean:

| pool | strips | with an isolated octave spike |
|---|---|---|
| strips_nota | 1,747 | 1 (0.1%) |
| strips_r1 | 421 | 1 (0.2%) |
| strips_tup | 169 | 0 |
| strips_v4 | 40,826 | 36 (0.1%) |

≈1% of exam edits. Worth fixing for correctness; **not** an explanation for the pitch weakness.

### Re-scored under low-n-robust headlines (2026-07-27) — the regression was a metric artifact

Recomputed from the stored `per_class` blocks by `scripts/rung3/rescore_headline.py`; no model was
re-run, and no exam was re-read. **MICRO** pools tokens instead of classes (Σhit/Σgold), so one rare
class cannot swing it. **MACRO≥30** is the same per-class mean restricted to classes with ≥30 gold.

| 326 clean strips | Round 1 | Round 2 | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| macro recall *(the historical headline)* | 78.5% | 74.2% | −4.3pp |
| macro F1 | 78.0% | 73.9% | −4.1pp |
| **micro recall** | 83.9% | **84.8%** | **+0.9pp** |
| **micro F1** | **85.0%** | 84.8% | −0.2pp |
| **macro≥30 recall** | 81.4% | **84.8%** | **+3.4pp** |
| **macro≥30 F1** | 83.9% | **84.4%** | +0.5pp |

**Round 2 is not a regression.** On every low-n-robust measure it is flat-to-better, and that is
before counting SER, exact-match and the 9-of-11 floors. The −4pp came from `\komaSharp` (n=14)
inside a six-class average.

⚠ **Do not read the ~85% micro figures as hitting the 85% target.** That floor was pre-registered
against the MACRO mean; micro is a different, structurally higher number here because the
well-read common classes carry most of the tokens. Retrospectively, macro has been reporting
66–78% while token-level accidental accuracy sat at 83–85% for both models.

**Token-level accuracy improved; the per-class headline regressed.** Round-2 per-class recall:
koma♯ 21.4, bakiye♯ 91.7, küçük♯ 69.7, koma♭ 90.5, bakiye♭ 87.0, küçük♭ 85.0 → mean 74.2%.
`\komaSharp` (F1 **21.4%**, n=14) accounts for the whole drop: a mean over six classes moves ~4pp
when one class moves 25pp. Same low-n fragility flagged above.

Round-2 recall by print position (the split `eval_omr.py` now reports):

| | signature gold | signature recall | inline gold | inline recall |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `\kucukSharp` | 32 | **72%** | 1 | 0% |
| `\komaSharp` | 12 | **8%** | 2 | 100% |
| `\bakiyeSharp` | 57 | 91% | 88 | 92% |
| `\kucukFlat` | 49 | 82% | 11 | 100% |

- **The targeted fix worked:** küçük-in-signature 50% (`round1-best`, photo gold) → **72%**; overall
  küçük recall 58.1% → 69.7%. Its precision fell **100% → 76.7%**, the pre-registered trade.
- **What replaced the old failure:** on the 156 mismatching strips the substitutions are
  `\kucukSharp → \komaSharp` **8×** and `\komaSharp → \kucukSharp` **7×**, **all 15 inside the
  `\sig` block**, with net `\komaSharp` emission of **0**.
- So the Round-1 error — one-directional, küçük read as koma, reverse essentially never — is gone.
  What remains is a **symmetric koma↔küçük discrimination failure confined to the key signature**.
  It is not a re-flipped bias; it is a coin flip, and it destroys `\komaSharp` because n=14.
- **Untested lead:** the glyph-fidelity work (`sharp_probe`, bar weight, küçük pitch widened to
  0.65 S) was measured on INLINE glyphs. Signature glyphs are packed at `SIG_GLYPH_ADVANCE = 13 px`
  and were never examined — and that is where 32 of the 33 küçük gold tokens live.

- Exam v2.1 baseline per-source: neyzen 72.4%, nota 60.0%.
- Round 1 per-source AEU gap: **12.5pp → 0.3pp** (style overfit gone).
- ⚠ **~11 of the 12pp re-score jump is a metric artifact**, not model improvement: `\buyukSharp`
  (n=3, 0% recall) was corrected to n=0 and dropped out of the per-class mean. Token-level accuracy
  barely moved (SER 0.060 → 0.059).
- ⚠ **Contamination (found 2026-07-22):** 4 SymbTr pieces / 25 strips (7.1%) had their *other*
  engraving in the training pools. `strips_exam_v2_clean/` (327 strips) is the honest reference.
  The correction also moved komaFlat precision 66.2 → 63.8%; the verdict was unchanged.
  ⚠ **The POOLS were only cleaned on 2026-07-26.** The train-time guard was added in July but the
  contaminated strips were never removed behind it, so they sat in the real pools until Round 2's
  shakeout refused to start. 14 strips dropped (11 `strips_nota`, 3 `strips_tup`); real pools are
  now 2,337 strips / 444 pieces, 0 in the exam. Originals kept as `manifest.jsonl.pre-examclean`,
  list in `data/real/rung3/excluded_exam_pieces.txt`.
- ⚠ **Second contamination channel (found 2026-07-26): the SYNTHETIC corpus.** 5 of the 190
  `strips_v3` pieces are exam pieces — `hisarbuselik--vuslata_nail`, two `kurdilihicazkar` şarkıs,
  `mahur--cihani_lal-i`, `nikriz--zeybek`. The train-time guard only checks the `--real-dir` pools,
  so our own render of an exam piece passed it. Excluded from the next corpus; the Round-1 numbers
  above were measured with them present.

### Round-1 floors vs what was achieved (pre-registered 2026-07-20)

⚠ **These are Rounds 1 and 2's floors. Round 3 has its OWN, signed 2026-08-15** —
[rung3/round3-criteria.md](rung3/round3-criteria.md), where the pass/fail number is the product one
(≥75% of pages needing ≤5 corrections) and the accidental measures below become no-regression
clauses. Do not judge Round 3 against this table.

Round 2 was read against the same floors (never re-registered, so the comparison stays honest).
Its column is measured on the 326-strip clean set; Round 1's is its original as-read 352.

| Floor | Target | Baseline | Round 1 | | Round 2 | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AEU headline | ≥85% | 64.1% | 66.6% | ⛔ | 74.2% | ⛔ |
| mean AEU F1 | ≥80% | 57.0% | 67.0% | ⛔ | 73.9% | ⛔ |
| `\tup3` recall | ≥85% | 92.7% | 72.7% | ⛔ | 83.8% | ⛔ |
| `\kucukSharp` recall | ≥75% | 22.6% | 58.1% | ⛔ | 69.7% | ⛔ |
| `\komaFlat` precision | ≥70% | 53.8% | 66.2% | ⛔ | 73.1% | ✅ |
| `\tup3` precision | ≥70% | 15.1% | 93.0% | ✅ | 91.2% | ✅ |
| arc-triggered false `\tup3` | ≤10% | 77.6% | 0.0% (0/85) | ✅ | 0.0% (0/81) | ✅ |
| SER | ≤0.06 | 0.147 | 0.059 | ✅ | 0.052 | ✅ |
| exact match | ≥45% | 17.3% | 49.1% | ✅ | 52.1% | ✅ |
| per-source gap | ≤12pp | 12.5pp | 0.3pp | ✅ | 0.0pp | ✅ |
| synthetic no-regression | ≥99% | 99.9% | 93.0% | ⛔ | not measured | — |

Round 2 clears one floor Round 1 missed (`\komaFlat` precision), misses four, and is better on every
floor except the two headlines — a per-class mean that `\komaSharp` collapsed. Ties carry **no
floor** on purpose (~38% structurally noisy gold); the arc-triggered false-`\tup3` rate replaces
them, over 85 tie-but-no-tup3 and 229 neither-token strips. Full reasoning:
