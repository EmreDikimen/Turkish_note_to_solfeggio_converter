# The microtonal-sharp defect — the glyph investigation

purpose: the single home for the koma/küçük sharp confusion — what was measured on real print, what the renderer was doing wrong, and where the sharps actually appear on a page
audience: agents and the owner working on the AEU accidental classes

Split out of [METRICS-DIAGNOSTICS.md](METRICS-DIAGNOSTICS.md) on 2026-08-19 when that file crossed
the 400-line cap. The split is by genre: that file keeps the **investigations into how the model
reads a page**; this one keeps the one investigation into **a glyph we were drawing wrong**. Nothing
is duplicated. The fix it produced is `--thin-sharps` / `drawThinSharps`, on in every corpus since
`strips_v5`.

## The microtonal-sharp defect (measured against two real printed editions)

| Quantity | Real print | Bravura (ours, before) | Ours, after `--thin-sharps` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sharp bar thickness | 0.300 S | 0.367 S (+22%) | 0.300 S |
| küçük bar pitch (spacing) | 0.550 S | 0.483 S (−14%) | 0.65 S (deliberately wider) |
| küçük white gap | 0.250 S | **0.116 S** (~1–2 px after the encoder shrink) | clears the shrink |

- koma/bakiye were never at risk (0.58–0.66 S gaps).
- The error was **one-directional**: gold `\kucukSharp` decoded as `\komaSharp` **11× on the clean
  exam, 10× on photos**; the reverse essentially never. Matches the 100%-precision / 48%-recall
  signature.
- Resolution was **ruled out for this defect**: recall does not fall with encoder scale
  (1.22 → 0.24) on either dataset; `\bakiyeSharp` holds 84–94% in every bucket. ⚠ **Scope, added
  2026-08-15:** that test was per-class ACCIDENTAL RECALL, on glyphs that survive a shrink. It was
  never run against the edit budget, and the edit budget *does* move with encoder scale — see "The
  encoder's input box" above. Both statements stand; they are about different measures.
### Where the sharps are PRINTED (measured 2026-07-26 — corrects the framing above)

Every gold and corpus label split into tokens inside the row-start `\sig … \sigend` block versus
tokens on a note. The scorers count both (no stripping), so both feed the AEU headline.

| Set | `\kucukSharp` on a note | `\kucukSharp` in the signature |
|---|---|---|
| Clean exam v2.1 (352 strips) | **1** | **30** |
| Clean exam, contamination-corrected (326) | 1 | 32 |
| Photo gold (109 hand-corrected labels) | 3 | 13 |
| `strips_v3` corpus | 234 tokens / 206 strips | 1,210 strips |

- **The class is scored almost entirely in the key signature**, not on noteheads. `\komaSharp` runs
  the same way on the exam (2 inline / 12 in-signature).
- Structural reason: the carry serializer's `sigTolerant` rule prints a note bare when its
  alteration runs the same direction as the signature's (SymbTr stores the SOUNDING value — eviç is
  a 5-comma F♯ printed bare under a koma-sharp-F signature). Real pages therefore rarely print
  küçük on a note at all. Verified end-to-end: a dry render of two küçük-heavy pieces under
  non-küçük signature variants produced **zero** inline `\kucukSharp`.
- **In the context that scores, `strips_v3` is not imbalanced**: küçük appears in 1,210 signature
  strips against koma's 1,422 (bakiye 6,512). The 9× "1,887 vs 206" gap below is an inline-only
  statistic about a context holding ~1 of the exam's 33 küçük tokens.
- The real corpus gap is **diversity, not count**: signature-position küçük comes from just **3
  makams** (mahur, nisaburek, süzidilara) and 4 distinct spellings.
- **Inline counts, for the record:** `strips_v3` carries `\komaSharp` inline in 1,887 strips vs
  `\kucukSharp` in 206 (0.5%), and zero strips hold both. Kept because it is a true statement about
  note-position coverage — it is simply not what the exam measures.
